# Implementing a Read-Only MCP Server for Neo4j in Go (SSE)

[Video Tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1g8TozyEE7/)

## Introduction  

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Go to create an MCP server that can access a Neo4j database. Once implemented, you can query the server's status via a large language model (LLM) without writing any additional query code.  

Unlike previous connection methods, this time weâ€™ll use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to create and connect the server.  

The code for this tutorial: [https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-tutorial/tree/main/neo4j-go-server](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-tutorial/tree/main/neo4j-go-server)  

Itâ€™s recommended to download the code for this tutorial, as it includes a pre-prepared database file. Otherwise, youâ€™ll need to mock the data yourself.  

---

## 1. Preparation  

The project structure is as follows:  

```bash
ðŸ“¦neo4j-go-server  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚util  
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œutil.go      # Utility functions  
 â”£ ðŸ“œmain.go        # Main function  
 â”— ðŸ“œneo4j.json     # Database connection credentials  
```  

First, create a Go project:  

```bash
mkdir neo4j-go-server  
cd neo4j-go-server  
go mod init neo4j-go-server  
```  

---

## 2. Database Initialization  

### 2.1 Install Neo4j  

First, set up a Neo4j database locally or on a server following [this tutorial](https://kirigaya.cn/blog/article?seq=199). You only need to complete the first two steps. Add the `bin` path to your environment variables and set the password to `openmcp`.  

Next, create `neo4j.json` in the same directory as `main.go` and fill in the connection details:  

```json
{
    "url": "neo4j://localhost:7687",
    "name": "neo4j",
    "password": "openmcp"
}
```  

### 2.2 Import Pre-Prepared Data  

After installation, import the pre-prepared data. This data is an anonymized excerpt from my personal website and can be freely used. Download link: [neo4j.db](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-tutorial/releases/download/neo4j.db/neo4j.db). After downloading, run the following commands:  

```bash
neo4j stop  
neo4j-admin load --database neo4j --from neo4j.db --force  
neo4j start  
```  

Then, log in to the database to see the imported data:  

```bash
cypher-shell -a localhost -u neo4j -p openmcp  
```

</div>  

### 2.3 Verify Go-to-Database Connectivity  

To verify connectivity and the Go driverâ€™s functionality, weâ€™ll first implement a minimal database access system.  

Install the Neo4j Go driver (v5):  

```bash
go get github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5  
```  

Add the following code to `util.go`:  

```go
package util  

import (  
	"context"  
	"encoding/json"  
	"fmt"  
	"os"  

	"github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5/neo4j"  
)  

var (  
	Neo4jDriver neo4j.DriverWithContext  
)  

// Create a connection to the Neo4j server  
func CreateNeo4jDriver(configPath string) (neo4j.DriverWithContext, error) {  
	jsonString, _ := os.ReadFile(configPath)  
	config := make(map[string]string)  

	json.Unmarshal(jsonString, &config)  

	var err error  
	Neo4jDriver, err = neo4j.NewDriverWithContext(  
		config["url"],   
		neo4j.BasicAuth(config["name"], config["password"], ""),  
	)  
	if err != nil {  
		return Neo4jDriver, err  
	}  
	return Neo4jDriver, nil  
}  

// Execute a read-only Cypher query  
func ExecuteReadOnlyCypherQuery(  
	cypher string,  
) ([]map[string]any, error) {  
	session := Neo4jDriver.NewSession(context.TODO(), neo4j.SessionConfig{  
		AccessMode: neo4j.AccessModeRead,  
	})  

	defer session.Close(context.TODO())  

	result, err := session.Run(context.TODO(), cypher, nil)  
	if err != nil {  
		fmt.Println(err.Error())  
		return nil, err  
	}  

	var records []map[string]any  
	for result.Next(context.TODO()) {  
		records = append(records, result.Record().AsMap())  
	}  

	return records, nil  
}  
```  

Add the following code to `main.go`:  

```go
package main  

import (  
	"fmt"  
	"neo4j-go-server/util"  
)  

var (  
	neo4jPath string = "./neo4j.json"  
)  

func main() {  
	_, err := util.CreateNeo4jDriver(neo4jPath)  
	if err != nil {  
		fmt.Println(err)  
		return  
	}  

	fmt.Println("Neo4j driver created successfully")	  
}  
```  

Run the program to verify database connectivity:  

```bash
go run main.go  
```  

If the output is `Neo4j driver created successfully`, the connection is successful.

## 3. Implement the MCP Server  

The most popular Go MCP SDK is `mark3labs/mcp-go`. Weâ€™ll use this.  

> The demo for `mark3labs/mcp-go` is at [https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go](https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go). Itâ€™s very simple, so weâ€™ll use it directly.  

Install it first:  

```bash
go get github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go  
```  

Then, add the following code to `main.go`:  

```go
// ... existing code ...  

var (  
	addr string = "localhost:8083"  
)  

func main() {  
	// ... existing code ...  

	s := server.NewMCPServer(  
		"Read-Only Neo4j Server",  
		"0.0.1",  
		server.WithToolCapabilities(true),  
	)  

	srv := server.NewSSEServer(s)  

	// Define the schema for the `executeReadOnlyCypherQuery` tool  
	executeReadOnlyCypherQuery := mcp.NewTool("executeReadOnlyCypherQuery",  
		mcp.WithDescription("Execute a read-only Cypher query"),  
		mcp.WithString("cypher",  
			mcp.Required(),  
			mcp.Description("Cypher query statement (must be read-only)"),  
		),  
	)  

	// Bind the actual function to the declared schema  
	s.AddTool(executeReadOnlyCypherQuery, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {  
		args, ok := request.Params.Arguments.(map[string]interface{})  
		if !ok {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), fmt.Errorf("invalid arguments type")  
		}  
		cypher, ok := args["cypher"].(string)  
		if !ok {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), fmt.Errorf("cypher argument is not a string")  
		}  
		result, err := util.ExecuteReadOnlyCypherQuery(cypher)  

		fmt.Println(result)  

		if err != nil {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), err  
		}  

		return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf("%v", result)), nil  
	})  

	// Start the server at http://localhost:8083/sse  
	fmt.Printf("Server started at http://%s/sse\n", addr)  
	srv.Start(addr)  
}  
```  

Run the server:  

```bash
go run main.go  
```  

You should see the following output:  

```
Neo4j driver created successfully  
Server started at http://localhost:8083/sse  
```  

This means the MCP server is running locally on port 8083.  

---

## 4. Debugging with OpenMCP  

### 4.1 Add the Workspace SSE Debugging Project  

Next, weâ€™ll debug using OpenMCP. Click the OpenMCP icon on the left side of VSCode to enter the control panel. If you downloaded the project from [https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-tutorial/tree/main/neo4j-go-server](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-tutorial/tree/main/neo4j-go-server), youâ€™ll see a pre-configured debugging project named "Read-Only Neo4j Server" under "MCP Connections (Workspace)". If you built this project from scratch, you can add the connection manually by selecting SSE and entering `http://localhost:8083/sse` (leave OAuth blank).  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-31a01f1253dfc8c42e23e05b1869a932_1440w.png" style="width: 80%;"/>  
</div>  

### 4.2 Test the Tool  

The first step in debugging an MCP server is always testing the MCP tool. Create a new tab, select "Tool," click the tool shown below, and enter `CALL db.labels() YIELD label RETURN label`. This query lists all node types. If the output matches the expected result, the connection is working correctly.  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://pic1.zhimg.com/80/v2-dd59d9c96ecb455e527ab8aa7f963908_1440w.png" style="width: 100%;"/>  
</div>  

### 4.3 Explore the LLMâ€™s Capabilities and Use Prompts to Encapsulate Knowledge  

Now, letâ€™s do something fun! Weâ€™ll test the LLMâ€™s boundaries because Neo4j is a specialized database, and general-purpose LLMs may not know how to use it. Create a new tab, click "Interactive Test," and ask a simple question:  

```
Find the latest 10 comments for me.  
```  

The result is as follows:  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-44fab30650051db4e3b94de34275af3a_1440w.png" style="width: 100%;"/>  
</div>  

You can see that the LLM queried the wrong node type. In my example, the node representing comments is `BlogComment`, not `Comment`. This means the LLM doesnâ€™t have a general methodology for querying databases. This is its current boundary. Weâ€™ll now inject our experience and knowledge step by step through the system prompt.  

### 4.4 Teach the LLM to Find Database Nodes  

Think about it: How do we engineers know that the comment node is `BlogComment`? We usually list all node types in the database and guess from the naming. For this database, Iâ€™d first run the following Cypher query:  

```sql
CALL db.labels() YIELD label RETURN label  
```  

The output is shown in Figure 4.2. If your English is decent, you can guess that `BlogComment` is likely the node for blog comments. Now, letâ€™s inject this methodology into the system prompt to encapsulate this knowledge. Click the button at the bottom of the image below to enter "System Prompts":  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://pica.zhimg.com/80/v2-e0fdd265e53dd354163358be1f5cc3f6_1440w.png" style="width: 100%;"/>  
</div>  

Create a new prompt named "neo4j" and enter:  

```
You are an agent skilled in Neo4j queries. For user requests, you may not know the corresponding database nodes. In such cases, you should first list all node types and identify the most likely match for the userâ€™s query. For example, if the user asks for "articles" matching certain criteria, you donâ€™t know the node type for articles, so you need to list all nodes first.  
```  

Click "Save," then repeat the earlier question in "Interactive Test":  

```
Find the latest 10 comments for me.  
```  

The LLMâ€™s response is now:  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-ccf4a5ecb5691620fca659dcd60d2e38_1440w.png" style="width: 80%;"/>  
</div>  

Much better, right? The LLM successfully found the `BlogComment` node and returned the corresponding data.  

However, itâ€™s still not quite right. We asked for the "latest" 10 comments, but the LLM returned the "earliest" 10. Looking at the LLMâ€™s call details, we can see it used `ORDER BY comment.createdAt`. The problem is that in our database, the field recording when a comment was created is not `createdAt` but `createdTime`. This means the LLM doesnâ€™t know it doesnâ€™t know the nodeâ€™s fields, leading to "hallucinations" where it makes up a field.  

LLMs wonâ€™t explicitly admit ignorance. Research on OOD (Out-of-Distribution) by Jinhui during his graduate studies explains the fundamental reason: [EDL (Evidential Deep Learning) Principles and Code Implementation](https://kirigaya.cn/blog/article?seq=154). If your curiosity matches your mathematical skills, give this article a try. In short, because LLMs hallucinate about things they donâ€™t know, we have room to inject our experience.  

### 4.5 Teach the LLM to Find Database Node Fields  

From the above attempt, we know weâ€™re close to the finish line. We just need to tell the LLM that in our database, the field recording when a comment was created is `createdTime`, not `createdAt`.  

To teach the LLM about fields, letâ€™s refine the system prompt:  

```
You are an agent skilled in Neo4j queries. For user requests, you may not know the corresponding database nodes. In such cases, you should first list all node types and identify the most likely match for the userâ€™s query. For example, if the user asks for "articles" matching certain criteria, you donâ€™t know the node type for articles, so you need to list all nodes first.  

For specific queries, you should first query a few examples to see what fields the node type has. For example, if the user asks for the "latest articles," you donâ€™t know which field represents the "creation time," so you need to list one or two article nodes to see the available fields before querying the latest 10 articles.  
```  

The result is now:  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-e7a2faf43249fe108288604a2eb948ad_1440w.png" style="width: 80%;"/>  
</div>  

Perfect, right?  

By using OpenMCP for debugging, we can uniquely determine an agentâ€™s behavior through the system prompt + MCP server.  

---

## 5. Expand the MCP Serverâ€™s Atomic Skills  

In the above example, although we injected our experience and knowledge through the system prompt, youâ€™ll notice that behaviors like "query all node types" and "get all fields of a node" are very fixed processes. However, system prompts are written in natural language, which is inherently ambiguous. We canâ€™t guarantee theyâ€™ll always be extensible. Besides system prompts, is there another way to inject our experience and knowledge? Yes, there is.  

For processes that are fixed and easily conceivable by "somewhat experienced people," besides using system prompts, we can also standardize knowledge injection by writing these processes as additional MCP tools. This method is called "Atomization Supplement."  

Atomization Supplement involves adding extra MCP tools that are "atomic" in functionality.  

> A tool is called an "Atomic Tool" if it meets one of the following conditions:  
> - The tool cannot be obtained by combining finer-grained functionalities in a limited way.  
> - The finer-grained functionalities used to compose the tool are not fully or reliably used by the LLM (e.g., assembly language, DOM queries).  

Adding extra atomic tools lets the LLM know, "Ah! I have other tricks up my sleeve!" As long as the descriptions are appropriate, the LLM can use them to gather additional information instead of hallucinating and failing the task.  

For the above process, weâ€™ve identified two areas where the LLM hallucinates:  

1. Getting the label of a node type (e.g., asking for "comments," the LLM doesnâ€™t admit it doesnâ€™t know the label and directly uses `Comment`, but the actual label is `BlogComment`).  
2. Getting the fields of a node type (e.g., asking for the "latest comments," the LLM sorts by `createdAt`, but the field recording creation time is `createdTime`).  

Earlier, we used the system prompt to inject this knowledge. Now, discard your system prompt! Letâ€™s play a more interesting game. In `util.go`, weâ€™ll implement two additional functions for the above hallucinations (tested, cursor or trae can generate this code perfectly, so you donâ€™t need to write it yourself):  

```go
// Get all node types  
func GetAllNodeTypes() ([]string, error) {  
	cypher := "MATCH (n) RETURN DISTINCT labels(n) AS labels"  
	result, err := ExecuteReadOnlyCypherQuery(cypher)  
	if err != nil {  
		return nil, err  
	}  
	var nodeTypes []string  
	for _, record := range result {  
		labels := record["labels"].([]any)  
		for _, label := range labels {  
			nodeTypes = append(nodeTypes, label.(string))  
		}  
	}  
	return nodeTypes, nil  
}  

// Get an example of a node's fields  
func GetNodeFields(nodeType string) ([]string, error) {  
	cypher := fmt.Sprintf("MATCH (n:%s) RETURN keys(n) AS keys LIMIT 1", nodeType)  
	result, err := ExecuteReadOnlyCypherQuery(cypher)  
	if err != nil {  
		return nil, err  
	}  
	var fields []string  
	for _, record := range result {  
		keys := record["keys"].([]any)  
		for _, key := range keys {  
			fields = append(fields, key.(string))  
		}  
	}  
	return fields, nil  
}  
```  

In `main.go`, declare their schemas and register the tools:  

```go
// ... existing code ...  

	getAllNodeTypes := mcp.NewTool("getAllNodeTypes",  
		mcp.WithDescription("Get all node types"),  
	)  

	getNodeField := mcp.NewTool("getNodeField",  
		mcp.WithDescription("Get the fields of a node"),  
		mcp.WithString("nodeLabel",  
			mcp.Required(),  
			mcp.Description("The label of the node"),  
		),  
	)  

	// Register the tools with the schema  
	s.AddTool(getAllNodeTypes, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {  
		result, err := util.GetAllNodeTypes()  

		fmt.Println(result)  

		if err != nil {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), err  
		}  

		return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf("%v", result)), nil  
	})  

	s.AddTool(getNodeField, func(ctx context.Context, request mcp.CallToolRequest) (*mcp.CallToolResult, error) {  
		args, ok := request.Params.Arguments.(map[string]interface{})  
		if !ok {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), fmt.Errorf("invalid arguments type")  
		}  
		nodeLabel, ok := args["nodeLabel"].(string)  
		if !ok {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), fmt.Errorf("nodeLabel argument is not a string")  
		}  
		result, err := util.GetNodeFields(nodeLabel)  

		fmt.Println(result)  

		if err != nil {  
			return mcp.NewToolResultText(""), err  
		}  

		return mcp.NewToolResultText(fmt.Sprintf("%v", result)), nil  
	})  

// ... existing code ...  
```  

Restart the SSE server and directly ask the LLM. This time, weâ€™ll disable the system prompt (create an empty one or delete the current prompt). The result is as follows:  

<div align=center>  
<img src="https://picx.zhimg.com/80/v2-1e88f7d8e04b949040a02673c13d6462_1440w.png" style="width: 80%;"/>  
</div>  

As you can see, without the system prompt, the LLM successfully executed the process. Perfect.  

---

## Summary  

This tutorial walked you through implementing an MCP server for a read-only Neo4j database using Go and SSE. With this MCP, you can easily query the database using natural language without manually writing Cypher queries.  

For cases where the LLM fails due to hallucinations, we methodically refined the system prompt to encapsulate knowledge. Finally, through the paradigm of Atomization Supplement, we packaged this knowledge into a more robust MCP server. Now, anyone can use your MCP server to query the Neo4j database with natural language.  

Finally, if you find OpenMCP useful, donâ€™t forget to star our project: [https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client)
