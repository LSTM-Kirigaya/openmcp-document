## What Can I Do for OpenMCP?

Although OpenMCP might seem technically complicated, there are many things you can contribute to the project:

* Contribute code or fix bugs by submitting a PR, if you're willing.
* Design new features for the project. You don’t necessarily need to write code — just proposing meaningful features in the [MVP Requirement Plan](https://github.com/LSTM-Kirigaya/openmcp-client?tab=readme-ov-file#%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E8%A7%84%E5%88%92) is already a great contribution.
* Develop examples of different agent applications using OpenMCP, or refine new methodologies for developing AI Agents. With your permission, we will integrate your tutorials into this site.

By contributing in any of the above ways, you’ll become an official contributor to OpenMCP.
