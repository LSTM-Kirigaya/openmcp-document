  <el-collapse-item title="What is OpenMCP suitable for?" name="1">
    As its name suggests, OpenMCP is an MCP debugger and SDK for developers, committed to reducing the full - chain development cost of AI agents and the mental burden of developers. Our mission is to create MCP tools that can solve real - life problems and save working time through OpenMCP, or help engineers and research scientists deliver demos more quickly and make this vision visible to the public.
  </el-collapse-item>
  <el-collapse-item title="Is OpenMCP free?" name="2">
    Yes, OpenMCP is completely open - source. You can not only use this product for free but also join us to realize your creative ideas about agents. The task of OpenMCP is to build an ecosystem around MCP. We believe that MCP development will be a highly customized task in the future, so our current focus is not to rush to create an all - purpose agent, but to steadily build the relevant ecosystem and infrastructure.
  </el-collapse-item>
  <el-collapse-item title="What is OpenMCP not suitable for?" name="3">
    If you try to develop an all - purpose, general AI agent through OpenMCP, you should invest all your money in the research and development of quantum computers instead of visiting this website. Remember, in this era, developing a full - domain general AI agent is likely to be equivalent to telecom fraud.
  </el-collapse-item>
  <el-collapse-item title="Who is developing OpenMCP?" name="4">
    <p>OpenMCP was initially led by LSTM - Kirigaya (Jinhui) for building MCP testing tools related to 3D work. Its main participants include employees from large companies, students majoring in computer - related fields at universities, and some active contributors from the open - source community.</p>
    <p>Identity is not important. I'd like to share a quote with you: "Don't tell me if you can do it. Tell me if you like it."</p>
